    <h2>Chaturanga</h2>
    <img src="https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/NiiLoC/phpBNAzBL.jpeg" height="150">
    <p>Chess originated from chaturanga, a strategy game from 600AD. It consists of four divisions of the Indian army:
      the infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots. The game was played on an 8x8 board with pieces representing these divisions. The pieces in Chaturanga
    is the foot-soldier, elephant, horse, chariot, minister, and the king. The foot-solier moves the same way as the pawn, the elephant moves as the bishop, the horse moves as the knight,
  the chariot moves as the rook, the minister moves as the queen, and the king as today's king.</p><br>
    <p>Chaturanga was played in India and Persia, where it evolved into shatranj. The pieces were adapted to represent the Persian army, and the rules were modified.
    As Chaturanga is not played anymore, some of the rules are not known. However, there was no checkmate and it is unclear if there was a stalemate.

    <p>Chaturanga spread to the rest of Asia and Europe. It became popular in the Middle Ages</p>

    <h2>Shatranj</h2>

        <strong>Shatranj</strong> was the Persian adaptation of chaturanga, which became popular in the Islamic world by the 7th century.
        The pieces were renamed to reflect Persian culture: the minister became the "ferz" (counselor), elephants became "alfil" (elephants), and chariots became "rukh" (chariots).
        The rules were similar to chaturanga but with some modifications. The "ferz" had limited movement (only one square diagonally).
        Shatranj introduced the concept of "check" but still didn't have checkmate as we know it today.
        The game spread to the Arab world after the Islamic conquest of Persia, where it became highly popular among scholars and nobility.

    <h2>Medieval Chess</h2>

    <p>
        Chess reached Europe through the Islamic world, primarily via Spain and Italy, by the 9th-10th centuries.
        The pieces were modified to reflect European medieval society: the elephant became the bishop, the chariot became the rook (from Italian "rocca" meaning fortress), and the ferz became the queen.
        Initially, the queen was the weakest piece (moving only one square diagonally), and bishops had limited movement.
        The game was slower than modern chess, often taking many hours to complete.
        By the 15th century, significant rule changes occurred in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain and Italy, leading to the birth of modern chess.

    <h2>Modern Chess</h2>

        Between 1475-1500, the rules underwent major changes in Europe:
        The queen became the most powerful piece (combining rook and bishop movement).
        Bishops gained their modern movement capabilities.
        The pawn gained the option to move two squares on its first move.
        The en passant rule was introduced to prevent pawns from bypassing each other.
        Castling was developed as a way to quickly protect the king.
        These changes made the game faster and more dynamic, leading to its modern form.
        The first chess books were published in the late 15th century, including "Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez" by Luis Ramírez de Lucena in 1497.
    

    <h2>Competitive Chess</h2>

        The first international chess tournament was held in London in 1851, won by Adolf Anderssen.
        The first official World Chess Championship was held in 1886 between Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort, with Steinitz becoming the first recognized World Chess Champion.
        The World Chess Federation (FIDE) was founded in 1924 to govern international chess competition.
        Chess became particularly popular in the Soviet Union after the 1917 revolution, with many world champions coming from the USSR.
        The first chess computer programs emerged in the 1950s, with IBM's Deep Blue defeating world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.
        Online chess has become extremely popular in the 21st century, with platforms like Chess.com and Lichess hosting millions of games daily.
