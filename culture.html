  by FIDE and hosted in another country each tournament. It is not part of the Olympics, however it was attempted to be incorporated in the world-wide tournament
  in 1924.

  Historically, the Soviet Union scored the most wins, with 18 gold medals. They placed first in every olympiad between 1952 and 1990, except for two.
  The United States has the most total medals won over time.

  In the most recent olympisd, held in September, 2024, in Budabest, India won the gold medal, followed by the United States with silver and Uzbekistan with bronze.

<h2>World Chess Championship</h2>
<p>The World Chess Championship is a month long event that decides the chess champion in classical chess. It is held as a match between the challenger, the winner of the 
  Candidates Tournament, and the current world chess champion. It is held every two years. In the first year, typically the odd numbered year, there are a series of tournaments to qualify for the Candidates Tournament.
In the next year, the Candidates tournament is held and later in the year, the World Chess Championship.
<br>
<br>
Fourteen games are played in the World Chess Championship. The player who scores 7.5, a value consisting of the games won and drawn, wins the championship.
120 minutes are given for the first 40 moves, then 60 minutes for the next 20 moves, and finally 15 minutes for the rest of the game. There is a 30 second increment for each move after move 60.
If the score is tied after 14 games, a tiebreaker is held, which consists of 4 rapid games, 2 blitz games, and finally a single Armageddon game. If a score is broken in the tiebreaker, the player with the most points wins.
